Welcome and congratulations on coming this far in the game. This stage
requires the use of a certain inviter program that you've just downloaded.
Good luck!

How it's done:
1. Download Qt SDK from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
2. Install
3. Load the inviter.pro project file
4. Take a peak at the source (127-0-0-1.no-ip.org is a very attractive host, or so I've heard).
5. Compile
6. Run
7. Enjoy! :D
